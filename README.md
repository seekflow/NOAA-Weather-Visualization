# Visualizing NOAA weather datasets with Matplotlib

_Done as an offshoot project while working through Python Crash Course, 2ed, by Eric Matthes_



The nature of this project was to gain experience working with CSV files in Python and then making a variety of visualizations with Matplotlib

I wanted to see how the annual temperatures varied between Austin and San Francisco (my two most recent abodes), so I pulled data from a bunch of NOAA weather stations and played with it to see what I could find out. Below are the outputs I created. 


_Check [this](https://github.com/seekflow/NOAA-Weather-Visualization/blob/main/sf_austin_weather.py) out for the code used_
_And go [here](https://github.com/seekflow/NOAA-Weather-Visualization/blob/main/3152763.csv) for the dataset_
