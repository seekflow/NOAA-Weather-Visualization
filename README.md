# NOAA Weather Visualization

## Visualizing NOAA weather datasets with Matplotlib.
## Done as an offshoot project while working through Python Crash Course, 2ed, by Eric Matthes.

### The nature of this project was to gain experience working with CSV files in Python and then making a variety of visualizations
with Matplotlib

I wanted to see how the temperatures varied between Austin and San Francisco (my two most recent abodes), so I pulled data from a bunch of NOAA
weather stations and played with it to see what I could find out
